    <p class="salutation">Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

    <p>I was excited to see your job opening announcement for a web developer. I have been developing web applications for over ten years and I believe my variety of experience &mdash; both professional and academic &mdash; would make me a valuable addition to your organization.</p>

    <p>Working as the web administrator for the Marijuana Policy Project, I was responsible for the maintenance of both their primary site of over 10,000 pages and regularly coordinated with different departments to deliver campaign sites targeted to specific groups and policy reforms. These sites frequently coordinated with larger media campaigns and this work helped strengthen my skills in meeting hard deadlines.</p>

    <p>I left <acronym title="Marijuana Policy Project">MPP</acronym> to pursue grad school in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University. My time at Vandy was divided between my lab which focused on interface design and the psychology department where I studied both experimental methods and computational models of cognition. My interest in computer models of cognition led my to Sun Microsystems for a summer to work on their music recommendation engine.</p>

    <p>This work includes all of the technologies your organization is looking for. I wrote Drupal plugins for both MPP and <a href="http://will.tip.dhappy.org/work/ticker/">Johns Hopkins</a>, and I have extensive experience with <a href="https://github.com/wholcomb/tip/blob/master/bin/file/list/rhino">jQuery</a>. Please see <a href="http://will.dhappy.org">my r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a> for more information. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
